            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            The magic of ratatouille lies in its vegetables and herbs. Using
            fresh, high-quality ingredients will take your dish from good to
            extraordinary. Here's what you'll need:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Eggplants
              <p>
                : Choose small to medium-sized eggplants with shiny skin. They
                should feel firm with no soft spots. Salting the slices and
                letting them rest for 30 minutes will remove their bitterness
                and help them cook evenly.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Zucchini
              <p>
                : Opt for vibrant green zucchinis with a firm texture. Their
                mild flavor complements the heartiness of eggplants.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Tomatoes
              <p>
                : Fresh, vine-ripened tomatoes are key—they add sweetness and
                acidity. Blanch and peel them beforehand for a smoother sauce.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Bell Peppers
              <p>
                : Red, yellow, and orange peppers bring color and sweetness.
                Roast them lightly to deepen their flavor before adding them to
                the dish.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Onions
              <p>
                : Sweet onions work best, as they caramelize beautifully to give
                the base a touch of richness.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Garlic
              <p>
                : Use fresh garlic cloves for a robust flavor. Chop finely or
                crush to release its full aroma.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Fresh Herbs
              <p>
                : Thyme, bay leaf, oregano, or rosemary lend an earthy warmth. A
                handful of fresh basil at the end adds brightness.
              </p>
            </li>

              <h3>The Cooking Process</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              Ratatouille rewards patience and careful layering. Here's how you
              can make it special:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Step 1: Prep the Vegetables</h4>
            <p>
              Cut the vegetables into uniform slices or cubes. This ensures they
              cook evenly. For a traditional ratatouille, the vegetables are
              sautéed separately to preserve their individual flavors. While
              this is time-intensive, it prevents them from becoming mushy.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Step 2: Build a Flavorful Base</h4>
            <p>
              Start with a generous swirl of olive oil in a pan over medium
              heat. Sauté the onions until they’re golden and translucent, then
              add minced garlic. Cooking garlic until fragrant sets the stage
              for bold flavors.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Step 3: Layer the Vegetables</h4>
            <div>
              <p>There are two popular approaches to layering:</p>
              <p>
                1. Rustic Style: Add the vegetables to the pan one by one,
                seasoning each layer with salt and pepper as you go. Stir gently
                to combine, allowing the juices to mingle.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Confit Byaldi Style: Arrange thin slices of vegetables
                (eggplant, zucchini, and tomato) in a circular, overlapping
                pattern in a baking dish. This creates a beautiful visual effect
                while infusing the dish with elegance.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Step 4: Add the Tomatoes</h4>
            <p>
              Tomatoes are the soul of ratatouille. Create a rich tomato sauce
              by blending peeled tomatoes with olive oil, garlic, and herbs,
              then pour this over your vegetables. Let it simmer slowly to coax
              out the sweetness.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Step 5: Bake or Simmer</h4>
            <div>
              <p>You can cook ratatouille two ways:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Stovetop Method:{" "}
                  <p>
                    Cover and let it simmer on low heat for 30–40 minutes. Stir
                    occasionally and taste to adjust seasoning.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Oven-Baked Method:{" "}
                  <p>
                    Cover your dish with foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for
                    about an hour. Remove the foil in the last 15 minutes to
                    caramelize the top.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Tricks to Make Ratatouille Extraordinary</h3>
          </header>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use Good Olive Oil:{" "}
              <p>
                A rich, high-quality olive oil enhances the natural flavors of
                the vegetables. Drizzle more over the top just before serving.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Roast the Vegetables First:{" "}
              <p>
                Roasting vegetables like eggplants and bell peppers in the oven
                gives them a smoky depth and prevents sogginess.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Layer Herbs and Spices:{" "}
              <p>
                Don’t just throw herbs on top. Layer them as you add the
                vegetables to infuse flavor throughout the dish.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Brighten with Acidity:{" "}
              <p>
                A splash of balsamic vinegar or a squeeze of fresh lemon juice
                just before serving balances the richness and adds a bright
                finish.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve with a Crunch:{" "}
              <p>
                Pair ratatouille with warm, crusty bread to soak up the juices.
                For extra indulgence, sprinkle grated Parmesan or crumbled goat
                cheese over the top.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Let It Rest:{" "}
              <p>
                Ratatouille tastes even better the next day as the flavors meld
                together. Cook it ahead of time and reheat gently before
                serving.
